Our visual attention is often drawn to salient but goal-irrelevant objects. Therefore, goal-directed behavior requires top-down control to mitigate such stimulus-driven attentional capture. Previous research demonstrated that observer’s search strategy influences differentially on the attentional capture caused by salient distractors. Also, additional working memory (WM) tasks increase the magnitude of capture in subsequent visual searches. However, previous studies have not simultaneously considered both the search strategy and the WM load. The present study aimed to examine whether attentional capture by salient distractors is influenced by these two factors. 

To address them, participants were asked to memorize the memory item in the WM task. The memory display contained one or three items in the low or high WM load condition. Following this, they performed visual search tasks in which they identified the rotation of a target T among non-target Ls. Occasionally, one of the non-targets had a distinct color from other stimuli. Also, the target-nontarget similarity was manipulated to alter observer’s search strategy. By assessing attentional capture by the singleton distractors, we investigated the comprehensive effect of WM load and search strategy.
