We constantly search our surroundings for information that supports our current goals. However, this goal-directed behavior can be disrupted by salient yet goal-irrelevant information that captures our attention. To counteract this distraction, cognitive control mechanisms—such as search strategies and working memory demands—are crucial. This study examined the interplay between these two factors to better understand their combined impact on stimulus-driven attentional capture.

To this aim, participants performed a visual search task while maintaining information in working memory. Working memory demand (or load) was manipulated by requiring participants to maintain either one item (low load condition) or three items (high load condition) in working memory. Concurrently, participants performed a visual search task, identifying the orientation of a target "T" among non-target "L"s. Occasionally, one of the non-targets was presented in a salient color. Search strategy was modulated by varying the similarity between the target and non-targets.

The results revealed that, under the low load condition, stimulus-driven capture was not observed during parallel search, which required less cognitive control. However, during serial search, which demanded higher levels of control, suppression of the salient distractor was found. Interestingly, a different pattern was found under the high load condition. While the singleton distractor captured attention during parallel search, the capture was absent during serial search. These findings highlight the critical role of cognitive control in regulating stimulus-driven attentional capture.
